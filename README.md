# Unity 2D game

This game was created purely for fun and serves as a challenge developed in a short amount of time. The goal is to jump from platform to platform as you move continuously forward. Missing or skipping any platform results in failure, and as the game progresses, the speed of the playerâ€™s movement gradually increases. The challenge is to last as long as possible and achieve the highest time-based score.
